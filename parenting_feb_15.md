## Too busy to be a kid ##

The pediatricians' appeal comes as American kids are being squeezed by escalating academic demands at school, the relentless encroachment of digital media and parents who either load up their schedules or who are themselves too busy or stressed to play.

The trends have been a long time coming . Since the adoption of sweeping education reforms in 2001, public schools have steadily increased the amount of time devoted to preparing for standardized tests. The focus on academic "skills" and "drills" has cut deeply into recess and other time for free play.

By 2009, a study of Los Angeles kindergarten classrooms found that 5 -year-olds were down to an average of just 19 minutes per day of "choice time," when they were permitted to play freely with blocks, toys or other children . One in 4 Los Angeles teachers reported there was no time at all for "free play."

Pediatricians aren't the only ones who have noticed.

In a report titled Crisis in the Kindergarten, a consortium of educators, health professional and child advocates called the loss of play in early childhood "a tragedy, both for the children themselves and for our nation and world."

## A natural necessity ##

The decline of play is a special hazard for the roughly 1 in 5 children in the United States who live in poverty. These 14 million children most urgently need to develop the resilience that is nurtured with play. Instead, Yogman said, they are disproportionately affected by some of the trends that are making play scare: academic pressures at schools that need to improve test scores, outside play areas are limited or unsafe and parents who lack the time or energy to share in playtime.

"We're not the only species that plays," said Temple University psychologist Kathy Hirsh-Pasek. "Dogs, cats, monkeys, whales and even octopuses play, and when you have something that prevalent in the animal kingdom, it probably has a purpose"
