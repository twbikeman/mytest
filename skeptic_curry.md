# NASA invites skeptic Curry #
Three-time NBA champion Stephen Curry on Tuesday signaled that he is willing to take NASA up on its offer to tour its lunar lab in Houston after his pronouncement this week that he does not believe humans ever walked on the moon. During the "Winging It" podcast released on Monday, Curry asked fellow players Vince Cater and Kent Bazemore whether they believed humans had ever been to the moon. The players said they did not, to which Curry replied:  They're gonna come get us. I don't think so either." The 30-year-old's statement created a commotion on social media and led NASA to extend an invitation to Curry to visit and see evidence of the moon landing for himself. Curry responded on Twitter to a story that included NASA's statement with a smiling emoji wearing sunglasses.
