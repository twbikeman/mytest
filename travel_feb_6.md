# An Adventure in Death Valley #

## Dramatic rock formations and barren landscape make this valley feel like an unexplored frontier ##

From the moment our car climbed over the rust-colored mountains and descended into boulder-studded valleys, a sense of peaceful solitude was the tone for our weekend in Death Valley National Park.

Only five hours from the coast, the barren landscape and dearth of cars outside our caravan of three added to the feeling that we were a world apart form bustling Southern California, away from civilization altogether, pioneers exploring virgin land.

It felt as though we ventured out onto the surface of Mars, or at least that's where my imagination took me. Of course, we're not the first people to set foot in Death Valley--far from it--but the vast expanses of open space, absence of structures and preternatural silences can inspire such musings.

## Visually stunning ##

It is astonishing that the land in Death Valley remains as pristine as it is, with its history of mining. In 1994, Congress expanded the area's protection beyond  it status as a national monument to that of a national park.

While its land is characterized by sparse vegetation, the rocky terrain is amazingly varied, from salt flats and sand dunes to snowcapped mountains and trickling springs. We entered the park through the desolate mining town of Trona.

Driving into the park from the west meant we could stop by the Trona Pinnacles, jagged peaks formed underwater up to 100,000 years ago in the now dry Searles Lake. There are more than 500 of these unusual tufa spires in the dry lake basin, their pores and jagged edges reminiscent of coal.

After our Trona Pinnacles pit stop, we arrived at our camsite in Furnace Creek by early afternoon with plenty of daylight left to pitch our tents, despite the shortened winter days.
