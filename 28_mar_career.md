## Cutting costs and turnover ##

Much of the technology used in the hiring porcess shows great promise for helping employers cut costs associated with high turnover, said Natalie Pierce, co-chair of the Robotics, AI and Automaton Industry Group at Littler Medelson, a law firm that represents management. One client, a department store that couldn't retain cosmetics department employees, discovered through analytics that it had mistakenly assumed that hiring gregarious employees would lead to greater sales, when in fact the best salespeople were problem-solvers who invested time helping customers. By changing the type of person it hired, the store was "greatly able to reduce training costs and attrition and increase the amount of commissions going to employees," Pierce said.


## Elimination bias ##

Some tech firms offering AI-enhanced recruiting services say they explicitly clean their data of bias.

Take Pymetrics, which creates custom recruitment algorithms based on how top employees score on online game that measure 90 different traits--such a attention or altruism. Applicants are evaluated based on how they score on the desired qualities.

The biggest reason companies use Pymetrics is to improve the fit and diversity of their teams, CEO Frida Polli said. To guard against bias, Pymetrics tests each algorithm against a candidate pool of about 50,000 people for whom it has demographic data.

## Optimism in human resources ##

Executed properly, artificial intelligence can help employers cast a wider net to "find the hidden gems you wouldn't find otherwise" and free up time to spend with high-value candidates, said Ravin Jesuthasan, managing director of advisory firm Willis Tower Watson. He believes resumes could be obsolete within a decade because so much infromation can be easily collected from the public domain.

Despite the optimism, high-tech hriing remains in the early stages. Most human resources departments are wary of automation, and few are using it in a way that saves time because humans are heavily involved in managing  it, said Katrina Kibben, CEO of Three Ears Media, a recruitmentt consulting firm.
