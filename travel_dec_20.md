### Paradise takes many forms on this Indonesian archipelago ###

I set off on a trip to West Papua, Indonesia, on the western half of the expansive island of New Guinea, for a cruise with SeaTrek Sailing Adventures, which runs educational and excursion-heavy 10-day tripos on samll, two mastted sailboats to remote Indonesian islands.

### The Raja Ampat archipelago ###
The 1,500-odd islands that make up Raja Ampat are at the center of the Coral Triangle, a hot spot of marine biodiversity at the crossroads of the Pacific and Indian oceans, often called "the Amazon of the sea." This wild frontier lies off the west coast of New Guinea--the world's second-largest (and some say least explored) island--and has been an in-the-know spot within the scuba community for about a decade. Divers from around the world flock here to swim with massive manta rays and glide through undersea forests of brain corals, blue staghorns and orange sea whips.

In recent years, the islands have emerged as a trendy destination for non-divers too, with new live-aboard expedition boats, eco-resorts and village homestays(with over-the-water bungalows for less than $25 a night).

### Let the real journey ###
I began my own journey in the port city of Sorong at the tip of New Guinea's Bird's Head Peninsula. I set sail the following morning toward Misool, the Raja Ampat island at the heart of a 300,000-acre marine reserve.

Foliage cling, improbably, to dramatic karst formations that rise out of the sea like shards of green glass on Misool's edge. Many of these formations hide turquoise lagoons that are so crystal-clear you can see blue sea anemones swaying in the water as you glide above. The lagoons are a favorite hangout spot for hornbills.who fill the air with their guttural moans as they whoosh overhead like helicopters en route to coconut palms.
